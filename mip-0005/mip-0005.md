## Abstract

Collaboratively add and edit documents stored on the blockchain.
Use URI pointers to link documents together.

## Motivation

Hyperlinking is the one of the core functionalities of the web.
One of the drawbacks is to run a website you must host it 24/7 at a publicly available
and discoverable location.
Because of this many people rely on services to host their content for them.
Using the blockchain, a one-time payment can get your document hosted indefinitely.
This not only creates an uncensorable internet, it makes it practical to control
your own content.

## Specification

Add new protocol actions:

| Action | Prefix | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Create page | 0x6d40 | location(181), title(181-len(location)), content_tx_hash(30) |
| Update page | 0x6d41 | last_page_tx_hash(30), update_code(2), <...> |
| Update content | 0x6d42 | (last_content_txt_hash(30)), content_diff(217/187) |

Update codes:

|||||
|---|---|---|---|
| Set page location | 0x01 | location(181) |
| Rename page | 0x02 | title(181) |
| Remove page | 0x03 | |
| Set content | 0x04 | tx_hash(30) |
| Set image | 0x05 | image_uri(181) |


Format of content diff:

||||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add data | 0x01 | char_start | content | |
| Remove data | 0x02 | char_start | char_end | |
