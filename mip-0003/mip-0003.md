Title: Delegated keys

## Abstract

Associate multiple keys in a hierarchy with a single identity.
The key at the top of the tree will be the main address associated with the identity.

## Motivation

Having only a single key associated with an identity has a couple of limitations.
First, your identity can only be associated with a single service.
Second, you must trust that service to practice good security with your key
and cannot use security measures like cold storage if your identity is being used regularly.

Having a hierarchy of keys enables linking an identity across multiple services.
The primary keys at the top of the tree can be secured in cold storage.
Intermediate keys can be used similar to being your own certificate authority
and using intermediate certs.
Can use schemes similar to OAuth to easily sign-in and link identity between services.

Can also be extended in the future to limit capabilities of child keys.
For instance you might want a service to be able to post on your behalf
but not change your name.

Another action that could be added are aliases.
Even though posts would be associated with a single identity,
you would know which services they came through.
 

## Specification

Add three new protocol actions:

| Action | Prefix | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Child request (MCR) | 0x6d20 | address(35), message(179) |
| Child acceptance | 0x6d21 | txhash(30), message(184) |
| Child revoke | 0x6d22 | address(35), height(4), message(172) |

If a child key is compromised, can revoke it and set which height to start ignoring actions.
Actions would still exist with the child key, but they can be disassociated with your identity.

#### Example Flow

1. You signup for a new service and choose to use Memo auth
2. The site creates a new key and issues an MCR transaction
3. You are redirected to Memo to accept the MCR
4. The child acceptance transaction is sent and redirected back to new service
5. Accounts are now linked, also no login required for new service
