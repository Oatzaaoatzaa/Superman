Title: Private messages

## Abstract

Create private messages with two or more memo users.
Also obscure communicating parties.

## Motivation

Sending private messages is a basic feature of a social network.
Using Bitcoin Cash, direct and group messages can be sent in an uncensorable, anonymous,
and asynchronous way.

Best-in-class encrypted messaging apps like Signal still rely on a central server to
relay and store the encrypted messages.
This creates a centralized place for people to be censored, for instance Signal has been
blocked in many places including China and Iran.

#### Security Concerns

Even though internet traffic can be recorded and played back later (which the NSA has done),
data on the blockchain has a much higher likelihood of being accessible in the future.

Quantum computers may one day be able to easily decrypt data encrypted today,
users should be aware of these limitations.

## Specification

#### Two new protocol actions

| Action | Prefix | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Private message handshake | 0x6d30 | address(35), encrypted_handshake_message(179) |
| Private message | No prefix | personal_key_hash(30), encrypted_private_message(184) |

ECIES is used for handshake encryption key.
A randomly generated key is used for regular messages.

The personal key hash is a hash of the encryption key, the user public key, and a counter.
Counter can be increased with each message or periodically so each message looks like a new room.
Recipients can easily check which messages are for group since the hash is deterministic.

No prefix is used for private messages.
There is a separate prefix encrypted in the message for different actions.

#### Format of encrypted private message

| Name | Code (First byte) | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| New key | 1 | encryption_key(50) |
| Other members | 2 | address(35) x 6 |
| Message | 3 | message(219) |

#### Example Flow

1. Initiator sends handshake to recipient main address
    - Handshake includes symmetric encryption key (see spec)
    - Can also post an initial message using the encryption key
2. Recipient responds when they post a message using the encryption key
    - Can include multiple recipients, people can be added to the conversation at any time
3. Any participant can publicly or privately invite others
    - Once handshake with coordinator, can read chat history to find messages
    that include other members

#### Bloom Filter Support

Participants only need to bloom filter on their pk_hash to detect handshakes.
Once handshake detected, can add bloom filter for personal_key_hashes of other users.
